 Insight:
Monthly sales and profit show clear seasonality. Sales often peak in November and December, which suggests strong performance during the holiday season.
However, some months like July 2014 and January 2015 had negative or low profits, indicating possible heavy discounts or unprofitable operations during those periods.
This trend helps decision-makers plan inventory and marketing ahead of high-demand periods and investigate months with low profitability for cost optimization.

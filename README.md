# Sales & Profit Analysis by Shipping Type 📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes order data to explore how different shipping types affect sales, profit, and shipment delays. Using Python (Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), the analysis includes:

- Summary statistics of sales, profit, order quantity, and shipment delay  
- Correlation analysis between numerical variables  
- Visualizations (boxplots, heatmaps) to understand distributions and outliers  
- T-tests comparing Second Class and Standard Class shipping for:
  - Sales per order  
  - Profit per order  
  - Shipment delay  

**Key Insight:** The analysis shows that shipping type does **not significantly affect sales, profit, or delivery delays**.
